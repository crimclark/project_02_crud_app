## StoreIt - File Sharing App

#### Overview

StoreIt is a file sharing app built with Node, Express, jQuery, EJS, MongoDB and Mongoose.  Uploads are stored in S3 on Amazon Web Services, and upload metadata is stored in MongoDB.  File types are automatically detected and displayed differently depending on whether they are images or audio.  Click on a tag to view all uploads with the same tag, or click on a user name to view all uploads from the same user.
